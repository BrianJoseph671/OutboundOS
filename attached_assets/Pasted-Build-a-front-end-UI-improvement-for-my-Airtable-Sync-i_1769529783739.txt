Build a front-end UI improvement for my “Airtable Sync” import modal. Context There is a modal window that appears after Airtable is connected/synced. It contains: 1) A preview table of the data to import 2) A “Map columns to fields” section 3) A checkbox or button: “Save connection and keep synced with Airtable” 4) An “Import contacts” primary button Problem The modal is too narrow. There is unused horizontal space on desktop, but the preview and mapping UI feel cramped. Users cannot comfortably see columns and mapping fields at the same time. Goal Make the modal wider by default on desktop and allow the user to resize it. Also make the “Map columns to fields” layout responsive so it uses horizontal space when available and stacks vertically when narrow. Requirements A) Modal sizing - Default width on desktop: 80 to 90 percent of viewport width, with a max width (example: 1200 to 1400px). - Default height: up to 80 to 90 percent of viewport height, with internal scrolling for content. - Add resizable behavior: user can drag the modal edge or corner to resize (at least bottom-right, ideally left and right as well). - Set sensible min width and min height so it never collapses too small. B) “Map columns to fields” responsive formatting - Each mapping row should display: “Source column” (from the preview) and “Destination field” (Airtable field selector) - Destination field examples: Full Name, Account, Role Title, Email, LinkedIn URL, etc. - When the modal is wide: Show mapping rows in a horizontal row layout (label/value on one line), with fields taking more horizontal space. - When the modal is narrow: Switch to a vertical stacked layout per mapping row (source on top, destination selector below). - Implement this using responsive CSS (flex/grid) with breakpoints and fluid sizing, not hard-coded widths. D) Usability details - Keep the header and primary action (“Import contacts”) visible or easy to find (sticky footer is acceptable). - Ensure the preview table remains readable and can horizontally scroll without breaking the modal. - Do not change backend logic, only front-end structure and styling. Deliverables - Working React component for the modal - CSS (or Tailwind) implementing default wide sizing, resizable modal, and responsive mapping rows - Dummy data for preview + mapping to demonstrate behavior Tech constraints - Front-end only - React + TypeScript preferred - No em dashes in any UI copy
