Build a front end only “Decisions” page for my Outbound OS app.

Stack: React + TypeScript. Use Tailwind if it exists in the project, otherwise use simple CSS. No backend calls. No database. Hardcode all data locally.

Page goal:
A Wizard of Oz decision surface that removes friction by telling the user the next best moves. It should feel like an execution queue, not a dashboard.

Create this file:
- src/mockData.ts

Use these EXACT people for all fictional data shown on the page:
- Jyoti Bansal (CEO & Co-Founder, Harness)
- Jean Namkung (VP, Strategy and Operations, Pinterest)
- Jose Mancera (Machine Learning Engineer, LinkedIn)
- MacKenna Kelleher (Implementation Services Manager, West Coast, Datadog)
- Nicolette Nigos-Loredo (Manager, Campus Recruiting, Datadog)
- Annie Williams (Senior Program Manager, LinkedIn)

Data model requirements:

1) Decisions queue (exactly 3 cards shown)
Use Jyoti, Jean, Jose as the 3 cards.

Each decision item must include:
- id
- actionType (follow_up_email, switch_to_linkedin, call, pause)
- personName
- title
- company
- reason
- channelRecommended (Email, LinkedIn, Call, Pause)
- priority (High, Medium, Low)
- lastTouchDate
- suggestedSubject
- suggestedBody

Recommended decisions:
- Jyoti: actionType = switch_to_linkedin, reason = "No reply after 6 days", channelRecommended = LinkedIn, priority = High
- Jean: actionType = follow_up_email, reason = "Opened twice, no response", channelRecommended = Email, priority = Medium
- Jose: actionType = pause, reason = "Not the right contact for this topic", channelRecommended = Pause, priority = Low

2) Activity feed (exactly 6 events)
Must include events referencing MacKenna, Nicolette, Annie, plus 3 more using any of the listed people.

Each event must include:
- id
- time (example: "12:14 PM", "Yesterday")
- type (positive_reply, bounce, marked_cold, opened, scheduled, unparked)
- text
- details

3) Parked leads (exactly 5 rows)
Must include MacKenna, Nicolette, Annie, plus two others from the list.

Each parked lead must include:
- id
- personName
- company
- reason
- parkedUntil

Decisions page UI requirements:

Layout:
- Header bar with title "Decisions" and subtitle "Do the next right thing. Approve and move on."
- Two column desktop layout:
  Left column: Decisions queue
  Right column: Decision details drawer and the Activity feed below it
- On mobile, stack sections vertically.

Decisions queue section (left):
- Title: "Next 3"
- Exactly 3 decision cards
- Each card shows:
  - Primary action line (large): examples "Switch channel to LinkedIn", "Send email follow up", "Pause lead"
  - Person line: name, title, company
  - Reason line (small)
  - Two pills: Channel and Priority
  - One primary button:
    - For switch_to_linkedin: "Draft LinkedIn message"
    - For follow_up_email: "Prepare email"
    - For pause: "Mark paused"
- Clicking the primary button opens a right side drawer with the suggested subject and body (fake text is fine) and a 3 item checklist:
  - Personalized opener
  - Clear CTA
  - One sentence credibility
- Drawer buttons:
  - "Approve"
  - "Edit"
- Approve behavior:
  - Mark that decision as Approved with a check icon and an "Approved" label
  - Move the approved card to the bottom of the 3 card list (visual reorder)
  - Add a new event to Activity feed like "Approved: [Action] for [Name]"

Activity feed section (right, below drawer):
- Title: "Recently changed"
- Render 6 events
- Clicking an event opens a modal with the details field.

Parked section (bottom, collapsible):
- Title: "Parked for now"
- Collapsible panel with exactly 5 parked leads
- Each row: name, company, reason, parkedUntil, and an "Unpark" button
- Unpark behavior:
  - Remove from parked list
  - Add a new Activity feed event: type = unparked, text = "Unparked: [Name]", details describing why it returned

Constraints:
- No em dashes in any UI copy.
- No charts, no scoring, no probabilities.
- Clean modern UI with tasteful spacing and clear hierarchy.
- Build small reusable components:
  - DecisionCard
  - DecisionDrawer
  - EventItem
  - ParkedLeadRow
  - Modal

Deliverables:
- Working React UI in Replit
- All data in src/mockData.ts using only the listed people
- Default export App that renders the Decisions page
- State management for approve, unpark, drawer open/close, modal open/close

Make it look good on desktop and acceptable on mobile.
