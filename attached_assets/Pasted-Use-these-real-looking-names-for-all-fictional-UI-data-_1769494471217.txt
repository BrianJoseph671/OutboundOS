Use these real looking names for all fictional UI data in the Wizard of Oz “Next Best Actions” page.

Build front end only. React + TypeScript. No backend calls. No database. Hardcode all data locally.

Create a file: src/mockData.ts and populate it with the following EXACT people as the leads used across the page:
- Jyoti Bansal (CEO & Co-Founder, Harness)
- Jean Namkung (VP, Strategy and Operations, Pinterest)
- Jose Mancera (Machine Learning Engineer, LinkedIn)
- MacKenna Kelleher (Implementation Services Manager, West Coast, Datadog)
- Nicolette Nigos-Loredo (Manager, Campus Recruiting, Datadog)
- Annie Williams (Senior Program Manager, LinkedIn)

Data requirements:

1) Action items section: exactly 3 cards
- Use Jyoti Bansal, Jean Namkung, Jose Mancera as the 3 “Do These Now” action cards.
- Each action item object must include:
  id, actionType, personName, title, company, reason, channelRecommended, priority, lastTouchDate, suggestedSubject, suggestedBody

Recommended actions:
- Jyoti: actionType = switch_to_linkedin, reason = “No reply after 6 days”, channelRecommended = LinkedIn, priority = High
- Jean: actionType = follow_up_email, reason = “Opened twice, no response”, channelRecommended = Email, priority = Medium
- Jose: actionType = pause, reason = “Not the right contact for this topic”, channelRecommended = Pause, priority = Low

2) Recently Changed section: 6 events
- Must include events referencing MacKenna, Nicolette, Annie (and you can reuse the others too to reach 6).
- Each event object must include:
  id, time, type, text, details
- Example event types to use: positive_reply, bounce, marked_cold, opened, scheduled

3) Parked for Now section: 5 leads
- Must include MacKenna, Nicolette, Annie (and two others from the list).
- Each parked lead must include:
  id, personName, company, reason, parkedUntil

UI behaviors:
- Clicking the primary action button opens a right side drawer with the suggested subject and body and a 3 item checklist.
- Clicking Approve marks the action as Approved and moves it to the bottom of the action list.
- Parked section is collapsible. Clicking Unpark moves that lead into Recently Changed as a new event like “Unparked: [Name]”.

Constraints:
- No em dashes in any copy.
- Keep the page clean and decisive. No scores, no charts.
- Implement small reusable components: ActionCard, EventItem, Drawer, ParkedLeadRow.
- Default export App and render this page.

Deliverables:
- Working UI with state management
- All data in src/mockData.ts using the people listed above
- No backend

Make it look good on desktop and acceptable on mobile.
