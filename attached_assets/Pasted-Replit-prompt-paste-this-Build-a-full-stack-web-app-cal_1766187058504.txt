Build a full-stack web app called “Outbound OS” that helps me craft structured networking outreach messages (SDR/BDR-style), run A/B tests, and track outcomes by outreach type. Focus on a tight guided workflow, reliable data capture, and analytics. V1 is single-user, local-first.

Core user stories

As a user, I can add a contact manually or upload a LinkedIn profile PDF, extract key fields, and edit them.

As a user, I can create an outreach message via a guided wizard that enforces a strict structure.

As a user, I can generate channel-specific versions of the message:

LinkedIn message to an existing connection

LinkedIn connection request note (tight character limit)

Email outreach (includes subject line)

As a user, I can create A/B experiments for a message, log which variant I used for each send, and track outcomes.

As a user, I can see a dashboard of success rates and funnel metrics by outreach type, campaign, and time period.

As a user, I can export data to CSV.

Non-goals for v1

No direct sending via LinkedIn or email. Provide copy-to-clipboard and a logging workflow.

No multi-user auth. Single-user is fine.

App structure (screens and navigation)

Left navigation with:

Dashboard

Contacts

Composer

Experiments

Outreach Log

Settings

Dashboard

Cards: total sent, responses, positive responses, meetings booked, conversions.

Funnel chart: sent → responded → positive → booked → converted.

Filters: date range, outreach type, campaign, tags.

Tables: performance by outreach type, performance by experiment/variant.

Contacts

List with search and filters.

Contact detail page with extracted profile fields, notes, and outreach history.

Add contact modal: manual entry OR upload PDF.

PDF extraction shows parsed fields and lets user edit and save.

Contact fields:

name, company, role/title, linkedin_url, email

headline, about, location

experience (free text or structured list), education, skills, keywords (tags)

notes, tags (industry/persona/seniority/region)

Composer (guided wizard)

A step-by-step wizard that saves inputs and produces drafts that follow this strict structure:

Template sections:

Personalization hook (1 line)

Relevance/value hypothesis (1–2 lines)

Credibility/proof (1 line)

Clear ask/CTA (1 line)

Logistics and close (optional line)

Wizard inputs (required unless marked optional):

Outreach goal (intro chat, referral, partnership, recruiting, advice)

Channel/type (LinkedIn existing, LinkedIn connect request, Email)

Personalization source (select from extracted profile fields) and a chosen hook

Value hypothesis (what I can offer / why this matters)

Credibility proof point (optional)

Ask/CTA (15 min chat, quick question, referral, etc.)

Timeframe (this week/next week) and scheduling preference (optional)

Tone (default from settings)

Length preference (short/medium/long where applicable)

Channel constraints:

LinkedIn connection request note: very short, enforce hard character max (set to 300 chars).

LinkedIn existing connection: short to medium, readable with line breaks.

Email: include subject line patterns from Settings; body can be longer.

Composer outputs:

Generated message + a “Regenerate variants” button that preserves structure.

Show 3 variants at once (A, B, C), each editable.

Copy-to-clipboard for each variant.

“Log outreach” button that creates an outreach attempt linked to the contact and variant.

Important: Use a deterministic template engine (not an external LLM call). Generate drafts from the user’s wizard inputs and contact profile fields. Make it easy to modify rules later.

Experiments (A/B testing)

Create experiment: name, outreach type, hypothesis, variable being tested (hook vs CTA vs length vs tone), variant A text, variant B text, start/end date (optional).

Assign an experiment to a contact/outreach attempt at logging time.

Stats: counts and rates per variant for responded, positive, booked, converted.

Add a simple “significance” indicator using a two-proportion z-test with a clear note that it is approximate, and only show it when sample size is adequate (for example, both variants have at least 20 sends).

Outreach Log

Table of attempts with filters: date range, outreach type, status/outcome, experiment, campaign, tags.

Each attempt fields:

contact_id

date_sent

outreach_type (linkedin_connected, linkedin_connect_request, email)

campaign (string)

message_variant_label (A/B/C or custom)

message_body (stored snapshot)

subject (for email)

experiment_id (optional), experiment_variant (A/B)

outcomes (boolean or date fields): responded, positive_response, meeting_booked, converted

notes

Inline editing for outcome fields to update as replies come in.

Settings

Default tone (professional, friendly, direct)

Default CTA text options

Email signature block

Email subject patterns (for example: “Quick question about {company}”, “{name} x {your_name}”)

Template rule toggles (include proof line yes/no, include logistics line yes/no)

Character limit settings for connection request.

Data and storage

Use SQLite for persistence.

Provide an API layer (backend) with endpoints for contacts, uploads/parsing, messages, outreach attempts, experiments, analytics, export.

Implement CSV export for contacts and outreach attempts.

PDF parsing

Accept a PDF upload.

Extract text server-side and parse into fields with heuristics:

headline and about sections

current role/company

experience, education, skills keywords if present

Show the extracted fields to the user for confirmation/editing before saving.

Technical requirements

React front end with clean UI (fast, minimal).

Backend can be Node/Express or Python/FastAPI, whichever is simplest for PDF extraction and SQLite.

Use robust validation and error handling.

Provide seed data option for quick demo.

Include clear empty states and onboarding hints.

Acceptance criteria

I can add a contact via PDF, confirm extracted fields, and save.

I can run the Composer wizard and produce channel-specific drafts that respect constraints.

I can log an outreach attempt with a chosen variant and later update outcomes.

I can create an A/B experiment and see per-variant performance and a basic significance indicator.

Dashboard and filters work and reflect stored data.

CSV export works.

Build this as a working v1. Prioritize correctness, usability, and a cohesive workflow over advanced styling.
